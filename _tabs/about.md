## About Me

Hi, I'm **Paul MoÃ¯se Gangbadja** â€” a passionate AI engineer and developer with a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and software engineering. I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Avignon, France, and working as a Generative AI Engineer Apprentice at **Amadeus**.

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve built and deployed production-grade AI solutions, from retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbots and agentic workflows to full-stack microservices tailored for HR platforms. My work spans multiple technologies including **PyTorch, FastAPI, React, LangGraph**, and **Azure OpenAI**, with a focus on delivering real-world impact.

In addition to hands-on experience, Iâ€™m continuously exploring new frontiers in AI through personal projects and online specializations. Iâ€™m especially interested in **LLMs, NLP, MLOps, model compression, and multilingual AI for underrepresented languages**.

## What Drives Me

Iâ€™m driven by curiosity, the excitement of building useful systems, and the opportunity to contribute to meaningful technological progress. Whether itâ€™s optimizing LLMs for constrained environments or crafting agent-based solutions for enterprise data, I enjoy turning ideas into impactful tools.

## Current Focus

- Building RAG pipelines and multimodal agents with GPT-4o and LangGraph  
- Experimenting with fine-tuning techniques like LoRA and quantization  
- Strengthening MLOps skills via the **DataTalksClub MLOps Zoomcamp**  
- Exploring multilingual NLP challenges in low-resource settings  
- **Preparing for Cloud Certifications** to deepen my deployment and production-readiness expertise:
  - ðŸŽ“ **Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Engineer Associate** *(In Progress)* â€“ Focused on designing, developing, and deploying AI solutions on Azure, including LLM and Cognitive Services.
  - ðŸŽ“ **Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Scientist Associate** â€“ Emphasizing model training, validation, and operationalization using Azure Machine Learning.
  - ðŸŽ“ **AWS Certified Machine Learning â€“ Specialty** â€“ Aiming to solidify ML engineering knowledge in scalable AWS environments, from data engineering to model deployment.


## Letâ€™s Connect

Iâ€™m always open to collaborating on AI projects, contributing to open source, or discussing innovative ideas over coffee â˜•.
