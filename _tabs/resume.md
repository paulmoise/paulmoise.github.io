## Summary

Final-year Master's student in Artificial Intelligence with 2 years of experience in LLM-based applications and 1.5 years in fullstack development. Deployed RAG pipelines and multimodal agents at Amadeus using GPT-4o and Azure OpenAI. Solid foundation in ML/DL, hands-on MLOps (MLflow, SHAP, CI/CD), and strong Python expertise. Actively deepening skills in MLOps and preparing 3 cloud certifications: Azure AI Engineer Certification, Datascientist Associate and AWS Machine Learning Engineer Associate.

## Work Experience

**Generative AI Engineer Apprentice**  
*Amadeus, Nice, France — 2023–Present*  
- Designed and deployed a production-ready RAG chatbot using GPT-4o, Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search and Langfuse to process 1200+ pages of internal documentation.  
- Migrated solution to Agentic RAG with `Langgraph` in a modular stack with `FastAPI`, `PostgreSQL`, and `React`; deployed on Azure Web App for Big Data Platform.  
- Built a Streamlit app for analyzing Incident Records (IRs) with LLMs; integrated results into Power BI dashboards.

**Full Stack Web Developer**  
*Erugis Consulting, Remote — Feb 2022 – Aug 2023*  
- Designed and developed microservices (Paid Leave, File Storage, Expense Management) for HR platform Uptimise using Django REST, PostgreSQL, React, Docker, Kafka, and Keycloak.  
- Built multi-tenant architecture and containerized backend systems.

**Web Developer Intern**  
*Open CTS, Benin — Jun 2021 – Dec 2021*  
- Developed Django-based backend APIs and React frontend for driver license management systems.

## Projects

- **[Bank Client Churn Prediction](https://github.com/paulmoise/bank-client-attrition)**  
  Trained models (SVM, RF, k-NN) for churn prediction using temporal split strategy; F1-score of 0.938 with SVM.

- **[Sales Performance Dashboard](https://github.com/paulmoise/powerbi-sales-dashboard)**  
  Created a Power BI dashboard with DAX measures and star schema to analyze sales metrics across multiple dimensions.

- **[ViT for Small Datasets](https://github.com/paulmoise/vit_small_ds_pytorch)**  
  Reimplemented ViT in PyTorch; enhanced with SPT and LSA for CIFAR-100.

- **[Transformer from Scratch](https://github.com/paulmoise/transformer-from-scratch)**  
  Built English-French translation model with attention and masking using OPUS dataset.

- **[Groundwater Level Forecasting](https://github.com/paulmoise/nappe-phreatique-australie)**  
  Developed neural models (LSTM, fine-tuned) for multivariate time-series groundwater prediction in Australia.ß

- **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**  
  Used SemEval-2014 dataset with NLTK, spaCy, and Scikit-learn for aspect extraction and polarity classification.

- **Clustering Classroom Occupancy**  
  Used KMeans on sensor data (temperature, CO2, humidity) to infer room occupancy patterns.
